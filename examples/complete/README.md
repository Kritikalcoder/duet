Included in this directory are example input/output for several programming
running through our tool. <file>.ed.duet is an example input program, and
<file>.ed.duet.output shows the running time of various phases of our type
checker, including the final inferred type of the program, which includes
privacy bounds.

Our input programs and output results uses several unicode characters. If you
cannot see some symbols, try viewing the files using Deja Vu Sans Mono or Deja
Vu Sans fonts.

The source code for our tool could not be anonymized for double-blind
submission. We intend on releasing our tool as open source via GitHub after
review, as well as submitting our tool for artifact evaluation. We would be
happy to provide a zip archive of the tool to reviewers after authors have been
identifiedâ€“we did not see any option to submit non-anonymized supplemental
material at submission time.
